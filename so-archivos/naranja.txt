Went back home again
This sucks gotta pack up and leave again
Say goodbye to all my friends
Can't say when I'll be there again
It's time now to turn around
Turn my back on
Everything
(Turn my back on)
Everything
Everything's changing
When I turn around
All out of my control
I'm a mobile
Everything's changing
When I turn around
All out of my control
I'm a mobile
Start back at this life
Stretch myself back into the vibe
I'm waking up to say I've tried
Instead of waking up to another TV guide
It's time now to turn around
Turn and walk on this crazy ground
Everything's changing
When I turn around
All out of my control
I'm a mobile
Everything's changing
Out of what I know
Everywhere I go
I'm a mobile
I'm a mobile
Hanging from the ceiling
Life's a mobile
Spinning roundâ€¦
